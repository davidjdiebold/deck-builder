                <p>Deckbuilder is a software that helps you to find-out the best mana curve for your deck. You can configure your play-style in the <strong>Curve Builder view</strong>. The following options are available : </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The turn of game where your deck will reach its maximum power. Use a low value for an aggro deck, or a high value for a control deck.</li>
                  <li>Computations precision. The more accurate, the more time to compute.</li>
                  <li>Hero Power to use in simulations. For example, Warlock card drawing abilities can be taken into account in simulations.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>You can impose some cards in the deck if you want to ! Just add them to the <strong>forced cards list</strong>. The mana curve of your deck will be adjusted based on this information. Also, card drawing abilities from fixed cards will be considered when computing the best mana curve.</p>

              <div>
                <p>As soon as computations are ended, you will find the best mana curves for your deck in the <strong>Constructed Curves view</strong>.</p>
              </div>
      
              <img src="img/tuto_results.png" class="thumb" alt="">
      
              
              <div>
                <p>You can also add some cards with given characteristics in the <strong>Library view</strong>, in order to use them in your deck. The most important things to consider when defining a card are the following :</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The mana cost</strong> of the card.</li>
                  <li><strong>The card rating</strong> is used by the software in order to compute deck scores. The contribution of a card to the score is proportional to its rating, and is increased if the card is played early.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cards Drawn</strong> are used by the software when the card is played. The amount of cards is immediately drawn by the player.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When filling a deck with a given mana curve, Deck Builder fills mana costs with the cards with highest ratings. A card can be added twice to the deck.</p>
